Automatic infant face verification with user interface. 

Face verification focuses on the children faces images in age range of 0 to 6 years, and is based on the Siamese Network and Residual Network/Inception Modules. Here using my collected infant face database from Youtube, which is not public yet. If you have any questions about it, please contact me.
