# Face_Verification_UI

Automatic infant face verification with user interface. 

Based on Caffe and Qt GUI.

Face verification focuses on the children faces images in age range of 0 to 6 years, and is based on the Siamese Network and Residual Network/Inception Modules. Here using my collected infant face database from Youtube, which is not public yet. If you have any questions about it, please contact me.

This project was built on C++/Python and Caffe with GPU Titan X Pascal. The user interface was build on Qt/C++, in which the pre-trained caffe model was embedded.
